In this project I try to visualice how animals adapt to changes and loss their terrains for action of humans.
I find out Databases about Kaggle, Google, and others, and chose a study with a data base in:

https://ourworldindata.org/

https://www.iucnredlist.org/

## Terrain loss in Years by human action.

Questions:
How many terrain we have and how it change aroun the years. 
We have 510 millions of Km² in Earth, about ~ 70% is under water namely we have around 150 millions of Km². 

Humans comprise a very small share of life on Earth — 0.01% of the total

I like to show us in this questions:

- How much percent we have changed and how?

- How it affected the animals?

- What animals have we extinguished?

- Is there any relationship between all this?

Here the [Kanban][1] project.
